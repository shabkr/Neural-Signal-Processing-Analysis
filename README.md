# Neural Signal Processing & Analysis

Python Implementation of the Matlab Problem Sets from MX Cohen's Neural Signal Processing Course, titled *"Complete neural signal processing and analysis: Zero to hero"*

[The complete course by MX Cohen can be found here.](https://www.udemy.com/course/solved-challenges-ants/) Please, refer to the original course lectures to learn and follow along with these exercises.

Thanks to user [dxganta](https://github.com/dxganta) for creating the original Python Implementation of Sections 1 through 9. User [shabkr](https://github.com/shabkr) is expanding on these original implementations.
